    <p>When experiencing issues, it’s helpful to first <a href="https://status.corporateclash.net/">visit the Status page</a>. This describes if the services are experiencing any outages, or are running as expected. The services it reports on are the Main Game, the Website, and the Login API.</p>

    <p><i class="fab fa-windows fa-1x" style="color:#1FAEFF"></i> Before you try to reinstall the game, delete all of the old files. Corporate Clash’s files can be found in the <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Corporate Clash</code> directory on Windows. A broken, outdated version may be conflicting with the new installation if the files are not deleted, thus causing issues when trying to reinstall the game.</p>
    <p>To completely ensure all leftover files are gone, please run the cleanup utility by downloading it from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d6enIhrdy2cU71B1FNbqNUJFwMPtBFiv/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

    <h3><a id="Q_My_game_is_missing_some_files_how_do_I_fix_this_93"></a><strong>Q:</strong> My game is missing some files, how do I fix this?</h3>
    <p>First, make sure that the version you are playing on is the most up-to-date version: the launcher automatically serves and handles updates. To update your game, you may close and reopen the launcher. If the issue persists, you must uninstall and then reinstall the game. This occurs when components might be missing in your game files, such as textures and models not appearing.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Check <code>#announcements</code>, view <a href="https://twitter.com/CorpClashStatus/">@CorpClashStatus</a> on Twitter, or <a href="https://status.corporateclash.net/">visit the Status page</a> to see if there is currently a server outage.</li>
        <li>If there is, you’ll have to wait for the Corporate Clash team to fix whatever issues they are encountering.</li>
        <li>If there is no server outage and other people are still able to play, chances are the servers are overloaded and crashes will be very common until the number of current players/logins has dropped. Please note the only thing you can do in this situation is to keep trying or wait for the servers to be less stressed.</li>

    <p><i class="fab fa-windows fa-1x" style="color:#1FAEFF"></i> In some cases, going to a new location will give you a black screen. This error ranges from opening doors, to entering streets: anything that requires a new loading zone. The only way to fix this is by pressing <code>ALT+F4</code> in order to close the game, as your game is locked and nothing further will happen. This also works in any other cases where you are frozen and the game will not progress.</p>
