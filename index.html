Where do I install Visual Studio Redistributable Packages? How do I fix <code class="highlighter-rouge">MVSCP140.DLL / RUNTIME.DLL were not found</code>?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visual C++ Redistributable Packages install runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries on a computer that does not have Visual C++ installed. The libraries are required to run applications that are developed by using the corresponding version of Visual C++.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oB4EbDs.png" alt="Windows"> This is required to play Corporate Clash. These packages can be downloaded on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">Microsoft’s official website</a>. Scroll down to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Visual Studio 2015</code> and follow the instructions. Both <code class="highlighter-rouge">.DLL</code> files are a part of the VS2015 Redistributable packages, and errors will be thrown if they either do not function, or do not exist.</p>

<h3 id="q-how-do-i-check-the-status-of-corporate-clash"><strong>Q:</strong> How do I check the status of Corporate Clash?</h3>

<p>When experiencing issues, it’s helpful to first <a href="https://status.corporateclash.net/">visit the Status page</a>. This describes if the services are experiencing any outages, or are running as expected. The services it reports on are the Main Game, the Website, and the Login API.</p>

<h3 id="q-i-tried-to-reinstall-corporate-clash-and-it-isnt-working-how-do-i-fix-this"><strong>Q:</strong> I tried to reinstall Corporate Clash and it isn’t working, how do I fix this?</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oB4EbDs.png" alt="Windows"> Before you try to reinstall the game, delete all of the old files. Corporate Clash’s files can be found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\Program Files (x86)\Corporate Clash</code> directory on Windows. A broken, outdated version may be conflicting with the new installation if the files are not deleted, thus causing issues when trying to reinstall the game.</p>

<p>To completely ensure all leftover files are gone, please run the cleanup utility by downloading it from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d6enIhrdy2cU71B1FNbqNUJFwMPtBFiv/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>To install the game again, visit <a href="https://corporateclash.net/play">corporateclash.net/play</a></p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<h3 id="q-my-game-is-missing-some-files-how-do-i-fix-this"><strong>Q:</strong> My game is missing some files, how do I fix this?</h3>

<p>First, make sure that the version you are playing on is the most up-to-date version: the launcher automatically serves and handles updates. To update your game, you may close and reopen the launcher. If the issue persists, you must uninstall and then reinstall the game. This occurs when components might be missing in your game files, such as textures and models not appearing.</p>

<h3 id="q-my-game-says-that-my-internet-connection-to-the-servers-has-been-broken-but-my-internets-working-fine-whats-going-wrong"><strong>Q:</strong> My game says that my internet connection to the servers has been broken, but my internet’s working fine! What’s going wrong?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Check <code class="highlighter-rouge">#announcements</code> or <a href="https://status.corporateclash.net/">visit the Status page</a> to see if there is currently a server outage.</li>
  <li>If there is, you’ll have to wait for the Corporate Clash team to fix whatever issues they are encountering.</li>
  <li>If there is no server outage and other people are still able to play, chances are the servers are overloaded and crashes will be very common until the number of current players/logins has dropped. Please note the only thing you can do in this situation is to keep trying or wait for the servers to be less stressed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="q-my-game-is-stuck-on-a-black-screen-what-happened"><strong>Q:</strong> My game is stuck on a black screen. What happened?</h3>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oB4EbDs.png" alt="Windows"> In some cases, going to a new location will give you a black screen. This error ranges from opening doors, to entering streets: anything that requires a new loading zone. The only way to fix this is by pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALT+F4</code> in order to close the game, as your game is locked and nothing further will happen. This also works in any other cases where you are frozen and the game will not progress.</p>
